# Repository and project to overhaul the looks of Pioneer
The repository for the eventual visual overhaul of Pioneer Space Sim.
Keeping it separate from the game for now, and intended to be a repository for a prefab parts and elements library everybody can use for creating ships.



## Asset Library

The asset_library directory can be used with Blender's Asset Browser. Currently it contains equipment mockup meshes, but the intention is to constantly update it. 

## Asset Sources

WIP files for those assets. Needs updating.

## Users

Sandbox playground for us, to try out stuff.
