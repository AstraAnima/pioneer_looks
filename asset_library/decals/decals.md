# Decal libraries for DecalMachine

### How to use
- Copy them over / import to decalMachine via the addon settings
- A better way is to create a Softlink into the addons assets/decals directory (so they are easier to update)

They will be at their proper scale when inserted. This is important for more elaborate details like sensors and such. Rescaling is allowed, but please don't go too overboard with it, so they are not messing up the sense of scale of the ships.

Other manufacturers will get their own libraries as I create them
